==BeetNG==

BeetNG is a fork of [http://beet.sf.net beet] a sourceforge hosted Java/Spring-based application behavior and performance data recording tool.

As Beet seems no longer maintained by its original authors, this fork was started. The main objectives are:
* fix and add support for newer versions of Spring (3.0 and 3.1)
* add new data persisters
* add tools to ease data analysis
* implement a VisualVM integration
* add JEE6 support
* replace the Easyant build tool by a more standard Maven integration
