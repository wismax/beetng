	/*
	 * Implementation is complicated by many issues, the first of which is performance.
	 * Interface method calls must return as quickly as possible to prevent measurement
	 * from interfering with application responsiveness.  Our only really expensive
	 * operation is event persistence flush, so we do this asynchronously on a TaskExecutor.
	 * We also log an event for each flush, so that if behavior tracking does start
	 * to consume significant resources, we can find evidence of that in the performance
	 * database and tune accordingly.
	 * 
	 * Another issue is memory.  We anticipate periodic flushing of completed events,
	 * but if activity temporarily exceeds anticipated levels, we want to avoid an excessive
	 * backlog of completed events waiting in memory.  So, we add a configurable flush
	 * threshold.  When more than the threshold number of events are finished, we automatically
	 * flush.  We also allow child events to be persisted before their parents complete, to avoid
	 * accumulating too many events in memory for long-running batch processes.
	 * 
	 * We also must worry about thread-safety.  Fortunately this one is
	 * fairly easy for us.  By definition each BehaviorEvent is tied to exactly one thread,
	 * so we can leave its implementation completely unsynchronized.  The only place where
	 * we have contention among threads is as completed events are added to the persistence
	 * queue, so we must add some synchronization there.  We enter synchronized blocks
	 * sparingly and leave quickly to avoid creating bottlenecks.
	 * 
	 * Finally, and perhaps of most concern, we have the issue of event lifecycle contracts.
	 * Attempting to start or stop created events multiple times or out of sequence, to stop 
	 * a parent event before all of its children are finished, to start child events before 
	 * their parents, etc, can screw up our internal bookkeeping.  In the worst case this 
	 * can create memory leaks in the form of unfinished behavior events tied to thread 
	 * local storage. At best it means that the performance database contains unreliable information.
	 * 
	 * To guard against this, first the system is designed so that direct API calls from
	 * applications should never be necessary.  Secondly, we do low-cost bookkeeping checks
	 * on entry to lifecycle methods to make sure that everything is being done in the
	 * proper order, both here and in BehaviorEvent.
